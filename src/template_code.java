Create a class, `IndamonGame.java`, within your `src` directory. This class should incorporate concepts such as fields, access modifiers, constructors, getters, setters, and a main method.

#### Fields

Identify the necessary fields in a game world involving combat between Indamons. Here are some suggestions:

* Player name
* Indamon object
* Score
* Enemy Indamon object

Each field should have appropriate data types. 

#### Getters & Setters

Ensure that each field has associated getter and setter methods allowing access and modification while maintaining encapsulation.

#### Constructor

Add a constructor method to initialize each new instance of `IndamonGame`.

#### Game Logic 

Build game mechanisms like 

* player movement,
* scoring system,
* interaction with enemy Indamons

For each mechanism, create a separate method.

#### Main Method 

Use the Java `main` method to run your game, creating instances of `IndamonGame` and initiating game mechanisms.

### Existing Code

Utilize the provided `Indamon` class and expand it with new methods as needed. `Indamon` class is a model of the game's characters with methods such as `attackOponnent()`, `printInfo()`, and properties such as name, hit points, attack, defense, and fainted status. Add additional functions or modify existing ones as necessary to accommodate your game logic.

### Existing Tests

Utilize the tests from `IndamonTest` to ensure your game runs without any errors. Add more tests if necessary to cover any new methods you introduce in `Indamon` or `IndamonGame` classes.

### Instructions 

1. Namespace: Please ensure your code is part of the `com.mydomain.indamon` package.
2. File names: Please name your file as specified above.
3. Function names: Please stick with the function names as given in the task.
4. Dependencies: Java SE only.

Use your creativity to make the game engaging while practicing your operator, loops, and control flow skills in Java. Happy coding!

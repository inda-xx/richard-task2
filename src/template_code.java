// Here you should type your package name
package com.yourname.yourproject;

public class Car {

    // Define your variables
    private String brand;
    private String model;
    private int year;
    private int speed;
    private boolean engineStatus;

    // Define an empty constructor
    public Car() {
        // Initialize the variables
    }

    // Define a constructor with all variables
    public Car(String brand, String model, int year, int speed, boolean engineStatus) {
        // Use the "this" keyword to refer to the instance variables
    }

    // Getter and Setter for Brand
    public String getBrand() {
        // Return the brand
    }

    public void setBrand(String brand) {
        // Set the brand
    }

    // The remaining getters and setters follow the same pattern
    // Write setters and getters for the other instance variables

    // Function to print details of car
    public void printDetails() {
        // Print all details related to car
    }

    // Function to speed up
    public void speedUp(int increasedSpeed) {
        // Increase the car's speed by increasedSpeed
        // Print a message about the current speed
    }

    // The main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Here you instantiate a new Car object and test its methods
    }
}

// Remember to create a new file for each class if
// the program requires more than this Car class.
```
This template serves as a starting point to build your Car class. Replace the comments with the appropriate code, following the instructions given in the task. You need to define the class variables, constructors, getters, setters, and other required methods. Implement the logic for each method based on its requirement. Finally, test the methods in the main function using a Car object.

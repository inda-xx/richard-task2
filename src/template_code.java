```java
// Player.java

    // Constructor for player
    public Player(String playerName, int playerHealth, int playerAttack, int playerDefense, boolean playerAlive) {
        // Initialize the instance variables using passed parameters
    }

    // Getter and setter methods for all instance variables
    // -------

    // battle method as per exercise 3.4
    public void battle(Enemy enemy) {
        // Implement logic as per exercise 3.4
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Instantiate a Player object and test the getter methods by printing to console.
    }
}

// Enemy.java
public class Enemy {
    private int enemyId;
    private int enemyHealth;
    private int enemyAttack;
    private int enemyDefense;
    private boolean enemyAlive;

    // Similar to Player.java class, create constructor
    // Getter and Setter for instance variables

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Instantiate an Enemy object and test the getter methods by printing to console.
    }
}

// Score.java
public class Score {
    private int playerId;
    private int enemiesDefeated;
    private int totalScore;

    // Constructor for Score
    public Score(int playerId, int enemiesDefeated, int totalScore) {
        // Initialize the instance variables
    }

    // Getter and Setter for instance variables

    public void updateScore(Player player, Enemy enemy) {
        // Implement logic as per exercise 3.5 with scope to variable shadowing as mentioned in exercise 3.6
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Instantiate a Score object and test the getter methods by printing to console.
        // Also, you can simulate battles and score updates here.
    }
}

For each class, fill in the constructor, getters, setters, and according to the instructions in the task description. Use the placeholders provided to fill in the methods correctly. Make sure you test your methods by instantiating the objects and using the getter methods.

Here is a basic template to help you start creating the FireDrake class.

```java
class FireDrake{
    private String name;
    private int hp;
    private int attack;
    private int defence;
    private boolean active;

    // Create getters and setters here

    // Create the constructor here
   
    // Implement printFireDrakeInfo() here 

    // Implement battle(FireDrake opponent) here
}
```

### Formative Assessment

After completing the task, you should have a class `FireDrake.java` that can model FireDrake creatures in Java. You should be able to instantiate multiple `FireDrake` objects and simulate battles between them. After each battle, you should be able to print the state of the `FireDrake` objects to see which ones are active and which ones have fallen.

Now, continue your journey in the dungeon, brave adventurer. Good luck!

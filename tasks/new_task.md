For this task, you will be creating a basic game application using Java. This game will involve player movement, a scoring system, as well as interactions with enemies. The goal of the game will be to avoid enemies for as long as possible while gathering points. 

Here are the features your application needs to include:

1. **Player Movement:** The player character should be able to move in all 4 directions on the game board: up, down, left, and right.

2. **Scoring System:** The player should earn points as they survive. The longer they survive without interacting with an enemy, the more points they should accumulate.

3. **Enemy Interactions:** The enemies should move around the game board too. If a player's character comes into contact with one of these enemies, the game should end.

Use the principles of object-oriented programming that you've learned. For example, the Player, Enemy, and Game can be modeled as separate classes.

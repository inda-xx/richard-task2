# Java Adventure Game 🎮

Welcome to your third exercise of Java Programming! Let's stave off that plaque of game development challenges. You will be creating a simple game app that includes player movements, a scoring system, and enemy interactions.

### ⏰ Deadline
This assignment should be completed and submitted before **Monday, 13th December**.

### 👩‍🏫 Instructions
For detailed instructions on assignment logistics and submission process, kindly refer to the [assignment section](https://gits-12.sys.kth.se/inda-21/game-instructions) of the course guide.

### 📝 Preparation
To prepare for this assignment, you must go through and answer the questions in the OLI material for Module 2.

- Visit [Working with Classes](https://kth.oli.cmu.edu/jcourse/webui/syllabus/module.do?context=f0f5a808ac1f78812f2a8re315bac70) to read the required material.
- If you haven't done so yet, please sign up and register for the course at https://kth.oli.cmu.edu/. The registration key is `dd1337-ht22`.

Don't worry if some parts of the OLI material and tasks seem out of context at the moment. Go ahead and read a bit further or ask your tutors for help, if needed.

### ✅ Learning Goals

This week's learning goals include:

* Designing Java classes 🏛
* Adding instance fields ✔️
* Adding a constructor method 🏗
* Creating getters and setters 🛠️
* Printing to the terminal 🖨️
* Using the main method 🌐
* Scope and variable shadowing 🚀

### 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

If you come across any issues or questions, follow these steps:

1. Check this week's [posted issues](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-21/help/issues). Maybe your classmates have discussed your problem already?
2. If not, post your question by creating a [New Issue](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-21/help/issues/new). Make sure to provide a descriptive title starting with "Task *x*: *summary of your problem*"
3. Speak to a TA during the [weekly on-site lab class](https://queue.csc.kth.se/Queue/INDA). Check your timetable to see when the next lab is.

Feel free to share your thoughts and engage with your fellow students, but remember, **do not share answers with each other**!

### 🎲 Assignment

#### 1. Designing Java Classes

Begin by designing your game classes. You'll need at least three classes: the `Player`, `Enemy`, and `Game` classes.

#### 2. Adding Instance Fields to Your Classes

Each class you design will have its unique fields. 

- The `Player` class may have fields such as `name`, `health`, `score`, `position`, etc.
- The `Enemy` class might include `name`, `health`, `position`, etc.
- The `Game` class can manage `player`, `enemies`, `totalScore`, etc.

#### 3. Adding a Constructor Method

Include a constructor method for each class. This method will initialize the fields of each object when it's created.

#### 4. Creating Getters and Setters

Encapsulation demands the use of private instance fields accessed using getter and setter methods. Implement these methods for your fields.

#### 5. Printing to the Terminal

Create a method in the `Game` class that prints the game's current status. This might include player health, score, and state (dead or alive), the remaining enemies, etc.

#### 6. Using the Main Method

Your game will run in the `main` method located in the `Game` class. This method creates the `Player` and `Enemy` objects and starts the game.

#### 7. Scope (variable shadowing)

Demonstrate an understanding of scope by creating a method in any of your classes that shows variable shadowing. Remember to use the `this` keyword to prevent errors caused by variable shadowing.

To conclude this adventure, prepare to demonstrate your fresh game at the upcoming session 🏁

### 💻 Task Submission

To submit your incredible game, upload your project to your private Git repository on the Git server. Remember to include all the source code and resources used in your game. Don't forget to reflect on your experiences in your weekly reflection for this week. 

Good luck, and happy coding! 🎉

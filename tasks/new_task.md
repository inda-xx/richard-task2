## üìå Assignment: Building a Library Inventory

You will create a basic system to manage library books. Let's get started!

### Exercise 1: Define the Book Class
Create a file named `Book.java` under the `src` folder. Define a `Book` class with the following private fields:
- `String title`
- `String author`
- `String isbn` (International Standard Book Number)
- `boolean isAvailable`

In addition, add the main method to test your `Book` class after implementing it.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Example Code </summary>

  ```java
  class Book {

    // Define fields here

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Book exampleBook = new Book("1984", "George Orwell", "1234567890123", true);
      System.out.println("Title: " + exampleBook.getTitle());
      System.out.println("Author: " + exampleBook.getAuthor());
      System.out.println("ISBN: " + exampleBook.getIsbn());
      System.out.println("Available: " + exampleBook.isAvailable());
    }
  }
  ```
</details>

### Exercise 2: Implement Getters and Setters
Encapsulate the fields by creating proper getters and setters in the `Book` class. Use them to access or modify the private fields.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Example Usage </summary>

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Book exampleBook = new Book("1984", "George Orwell", "1234567890123", true);

    // Modify fields using setters
    exampleBook.setIsAvailable(false);

    // Access fields using getters
    System.out.println("Is the book available? " + exampleBook.isAvailable());
  }
  ```
</details>

### Exercise 3: Add a Constructor
Implement a constructor to initialize the fields of the `Book` class. The constructor should accept arguments for all the fields.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Constructor Example </summary>

  ```java
  public Book(String title, String author, String isbn, boolean isAvailable) {
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
    this.isbn = isbn;
    this.isAvailable = isAvailable;
  }
  ```
</details>

### Exercise 4: Printing Book Information
Create a method `printInfo()` in the `Book` class to print all the information of a book object to the terminal.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Print Method Example </summary>

  ```java
  public void printInfo() {
    System.out.println("Book Information:");
    System.out.println("Title: " + title);
    System.out.println("Author: " + author);
    System.out.println("ISBN: " + isbn);
    System.out.println("Available: " + isAvailable);
  }
  ```
</details>

### Exercise 5: Understand Variable Shadowing
Examine the code below. Be prepared to discuss how variable shadowing is occurring and how to correct it using `this`.

```java
public class Library {
   private String name;
   private int booksCount;

   public void addBook(String name) {
     int booksCount = 1;
     System.out.println("We now have " + booksCount + " books in the library.");
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
     Library lib = new Library();
     lib.addBook("Java Programming");
   }
}
```

To fix the example above, remember to use `this` to access instance variables when they are shadowed by method or constructor parameters.

## üêû Reporting Issues
If you discover any errors in the exercises, please report them by creating a [New Issue](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-22/help/issues/new) with the title "Task *x* Error: *describe error here*". Acknowledgments will be given for bugs found.

Good luck and have fun coding your Library Inventory System! üìö‚ú®

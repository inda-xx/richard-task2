# Java Researchers, Assemble! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

For this programming task, you are going to practice designing and implementing classes in Java. You'll also get familiar with methods like getters, setters, and constructors. Additionally, you'll see the outcome of your hard work printed on the terminal! 

### ‚è∞ Deadline
This task needs to be completed and submitted by **Thursday 22nd September**.

### üìö Instructions
Check the [instructions on assignments section](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/java-21/course-instructions#assignments) to familiarize yourself with how to do and submit an assignment.

### üñ•Ô∏è Preparation
You should go through and answer the questions on the OLI material for Module 2.

- Read the material on [Inside Java Classes](https://kth.oli.cmu.edu/jcourse/webui/syllabus/module.do?context=f5e5a808ac1f088812f2a8ce315bac60)
- Go to https://kth.oli.cmu.edu/, signup and register for the course key `dd1338-ht22` if you haven't already done so.

> **Assistant's Note:** The OLI material might not align exactly with the tasks, so feel free to study ahead if you don't find all the material.

### üéØ Learning Goals
Goals to be achieved in this week's exercise are:

* Designing Java classes
* Adding instance fields
* Adding a constructor method
* Creating *getters* and *setters*
* Printing to the terminal
* Using the `main` method
* Scope (or *variable shadowing*).

### üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è issues and problems
Having any questions or problems? Follow this troubleshooting guide:

1. Check if there are [posted issues](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/java-21/help/issues) related to yours. Someone might be having the same problem.
2. If there are no related issues, create a [New Issue](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/java-21/help/issues/new) yourself. Make sure your title is clear, for example: "Task 3: Having trouble with constructors".
3. If your issue is still unresolved, ask a TA in person during the [weekly lab](https://queue.csc.kth.se/Queue/JAVA). Check your schedule for the next lab.

Feel free to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **do not share direct answers! Do not infringe academic policies**!

### üèóÔ∏è Assignment

Your assignment is to design a `Researcher` class in a Java file, `Researcher.java`. Your `Researcher` should have these attributes:

- `String` name
- `int` age
- `String` field
- `boolean` isPhd

For each attribute, you need to implement a *getter* and a *setter*.

Using the `main` method, create a new `Researcher` object, assign values to its attributes, and print them to the terminal.

Extend your `Researcher` class by adding a *constructor method*. The constructor method should take arguments for all attributes and set them accordingly.

Finally, add a `printInfo` method to your `Researcher` class. This method should print all the attributes of a `Researcher`.

Remember, the main aim of this exercise is to get familiar with designing classes in Java, adding fields, implementing getters, setters, and constructors, using the `main` method, and understanding the scope (or *variable shadowing*). 

Keep an aesthetic indenting of your code and use proper variable names to make your code clean and understandable.

Give your best shot, Java Researchers!

For this task, you are to create a simple Java game application. The game will be a 2D game where a player can move around and interact with enemies. 

The functionalities to be implemented include:

- Player Movement: The player should be able to move around the screen using the keyboard cursor keys (up, down, left right).

- Scoring System: The player earns points for every enemy they successfully interact with. But they lose points when they get hit by an enemy.

- Enemy Interactions: The player can interact with the enemies. For example, the player can be designed to remove (kill) enemies when they make contact.

## Instructions:

- Create a new Java application.
- Create classes for the game elements including the player, enemies and the main game. For the player and enemies classes, include methods that allow for movement, interaction with other game elements and updating the game state.
- In the main game class, implement the game logic, for instance, how the game starts, checks for win or lose conditions, and updates the states of the player and enemies.

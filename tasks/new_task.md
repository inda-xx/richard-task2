In this programming task, you are required to create a Java function `countPrimeNumbers` which accepts an integer `n` as its argument. This function should return a count of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Function signature: `public static int countPrimeNumbers(int n)`

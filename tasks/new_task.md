This exercise requires you to create a simple game application in Java. The game features different bots, each having a specific role and different capabilities like player movement, scoring system, and enemy interactions. 

Each bot will have the following attributes: bot name, hit points (HP), the power of attack, and defense mechanism. These bots will interact with each other in a gaming scenario where one bot can attack another bot causing loss of hit points (HP). 

The goal here is to practice: Object-Oriented Programming, Designing Java classes, Adding instance fields, Adding a constructor method, Creating getters and setters, Printing to the terminal, Using the `main` method, Scope (or variable shadowing).

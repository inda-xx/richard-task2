In this task, you'll be asked to create a simple console-based game in Java. The game will have a player character, an enemy character, and a scoring system. The game involves two components:

- **Player movement:** The player character should be able to move around in a pre-defined space, denoted by coordinates (x, y).

- **Enemy interaction:** An enemy character will chase the player in the game. When the enemy catches the player, the player's score is deducted by 1 point.

- **Scoring system:** The player's score increases by 1 point for every successful movement without encountering the enemy.

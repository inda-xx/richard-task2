- Simple Java Game Application

Build a simple JAVA game application which includes movement of player, scoring system and enemy interactions. This will help build your understanding of Java programming constructs, general object-oriented programming principles, and use of multi-threading.

### Task Description

Your task is to create a simple, text-based game, in which a player moves around a board, attempts to avoid enemy characters and collects points as they navigate through the game.

**Details:**

**Main Game Class** - A 'Game' class will act as the driver for your game. It should have a main method to start the game.

**Player Class** - Class 'Player' for player character creation. It should have attributes such as 'position' (Consider it as a 2-dimensional coordinate) and 'score'. It should also have methods for moving position and updating score.

**Enemy Class** - Class 'Enemy' for enemy creation. It should have attributes such as 'position'. It should also have methods for moving position.

**Game Logic** - If player's position collides with any of the enemy's position, the player should lose score, else they should gain score. All movements of characters should occur in threads with â€˜player' in one thread and each 'enemy' in separate threads.

**Note:** You can decide on the specifics of the scoring system, the board size (10x10 grid, for example), and the details of player and enemy interaction.

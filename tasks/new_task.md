The task is to build a simple game application in Java that incorporates player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions.

#### Environment
The game will be a simple 2D game where a player can move up, down, left or right. The player will gain points by gathering up collectables that randomly spawn on the game field. There will also be enemies on the field that move randomly. If the player collides with an enemy, then the game is over.

### Components
1. **Player Movement**: The player character should be able to move up, down, left or right across the 2D game field.
2. **Scoring System**: There should be a scoring system where the player gains points by gathering collectables that randomly spawn on the game field.
3. **Enemy Interaction**: There should be enemy characters that move around the game field randomly. If a player touches an enemy, the game is over.

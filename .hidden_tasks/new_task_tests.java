The following test scenarios cover different aspects of game functionality:

1. Test the Player's movement: The test should move the player in all four directions and verify that the player's position attributes have been updated.

2. Test the Enemy's movement: The test should move the enemy and verify that the enemy's coordinates have been updated.

3. Test the scoring system: let the game run for a specific period of time without any collisions, and then check if the player's score has been updated correctly.

4. Test the Enemy interaction: move the player manually in the path of an oncoming enemy, and confirm whether the game has ended and changes the player's status to not alive.

5. Test the game setup: check the initialization of the game, player and enemies, as well as the starting position and scoring for the player and enemies.

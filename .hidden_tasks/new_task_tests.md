Here are some test cases to ensure your implementation works as expected:

- **Test Case 1:** Create an item at a specific point and move the player to that point. Verify that the score increases appropriately.
- **Test Case 2:** Create an enemy at a specific point and move the player to that point. Verify that the score decreases.
- **Test Case 3:** Try to move the player past the boundaries of the grid. Verify that the player remains within bounds.
- **Test Case 4:** Decrease the player's score to 0 or below by colliding with enemies. Verify that the game ends.

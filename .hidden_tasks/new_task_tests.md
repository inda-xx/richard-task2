Your task should be covered by the following test cases:

1. Test that the `movePlayer` method successfully moves the player to a new valid position, and throws an exception if the new position is not valid.
2. Test that the `generateEnemy` method successfully creates an enemy at a random position.
3. Test that the `playTurn` method correctly handles the event of the player choosing a position occupied by the enemy (increments score and generates a new enemy), as well as the event of the player choosing a position not occupied by the enemy.

```java
public class Player {
    private int position;
    private int score;

    public void move(int steps) {
        this.position = Math.max(0, this.position + steps);
    }

    public void increaseScore(int points) {
        this.score += points;
    }

    public int getPosition() {
        return this.position;
    }

    public int getScore() {
        return this.score;
    }
}

public class Enemy {
    private int position;

    public int getPosition() {
        return this.position;
    }

    public void move(int steps) {
        this.position += steps;
    }
}

public class Game {
    private Player player;
    private Enemy enemy;

    public Game(Player player, Enemy enemy) {
        this.player = player;
        this.enemy = enemy;
    }

    public void checkForEnemy() {
        if (player.getPosition() == enemy.getPosition()) {
            player.increaseScore(-5);
        }
    }

    public void printGameStatus() {
        System.out.println("Player Position: " + player.getPosition());
        System.out.println("Player Score: " + player.getScore());
        System.out.println("Enemy Position: " + enemy.getPosition());
    }
}
```

The solution includes `Player`, `Enemy`, and `Game` classes as per the task description. The classes include all methods which are asked in the question and they perform as per the requirements. The `Game` class ties everything together and provides the ability to check for enemy and print the game's status. 

The tests include testing player's movement, score, and enemy's position separately to ensure that all the base functionality is working as expected. The tests also check the integration of these functionalities in the context of the game, such as checking for enemy presence and the impact on the player's score. It also tests for cases where the player tries to move beyond the zero point.
